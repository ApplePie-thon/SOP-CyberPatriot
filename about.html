      <h2>What is CyberPatriot?</h2>
      <p>
        CyberPatriot is an exciting, challenging, and competitive program created by the Air & Space Forces Association (AFA) to inspire students toward careers in cybersecurity and other STEM fields. Learn more on the <a href="https://www.uscyberpatriot.org/" target="_blank">official CyberPatriot website</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Club's Mission</h2>
      <p>
        Our Computer Club offers students the opportunity to explore the world of cybersecurity through hands-on learning and real team-based competitions. Students can choose subgroups such as CyberPatriot, and start learning key technical skills in systems like Windows, Linux, and networking through Cisco.
      </p>

      <h2>Key Features & Workflow</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Students join the Computer Club and choose subgroups (e.g., Cybersecurity).</li>
        <li>Students form their own teams from the Cybersecurity subgroup.</li>
        <li>Each team assigns roles (e.g., Linux Lead, Windows Specialist, Networking).</li>
        <li>Each system (sign-ups, team creation, resource access) is deadline-based and closes after a set date.</li>
        <li>Once teams are finalized, private team dashboards allow them to enter/edit system choices, NUCs needed, emails, etc.</li>
        <li>Team leads and sponsors like Ms. Norris will have backend access for registration and management.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>After Team Creation</h2>
      <p>
        Once group creation closes, teams will:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Access private chat or dashboard to update team preferences and equipment needs.</li>
        <li>Train in the operating system assigned to their role through the first semester.</li>
        <li>Communicate with leads and sponsors directly through website contact tools (not Discord).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Resources & Support</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="resources.html">Training Resources</a> – curated by leads and admins.</li>
        <li>All presentations and documents will be uploaded and archived yearly.</li>
        <li>A <a href="help.html">Help Page</a> will allow students to email or text Mr. Miller directly via AppScript.</li>
        <li>Scoreboard pages will show real-time results after each round.</li>
        <li>Previous year’s data will be archived after each season.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)</h2>
      <p>
        We are building a digital SOP site that includes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Step-by-step documentation for Linux, Windows, Cisco.</li>
        <li>Checklists and competition preparation guides.</li>
        <li>Clearly defined team roles and responsibilities.</li>
        <li>FAQs and support documentation.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Our Goal</h2>
      <p>
        Our goal is to build a professional, student-run infrastructure that empowers teams to operate independently, prepares them for competition, and gives both students and sponsors a simple, clean way to manage everything through one platform.
