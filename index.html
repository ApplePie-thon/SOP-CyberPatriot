            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sign Up:</strong> Students register for the Computer Club and choose their subgroup (e.g., Cybersecurity). Register <a href="signup.html">here</a></li>
                <li><strong>Create Teams:</strong> Eligible students will form groups and assign team roles. When signed up, fill all the information in <a href="groups.html">group</a> page</li>
                <li><strong>Set Deadlines:</strong> Team creation and role assignments will close after a specific date.</li>
                <li><strong>Team Management:</strong> After creation, groups will have editable dashboards to manage info like NUC requirements, OS focus, and contact info.</li>
                <li><strong>Communications:</strong> Each team will have a private channel for updates and messaging leads or sponsors. This will be done through the software Discord. Find more information <a href="help.html">here</a></li>
            </ul>
